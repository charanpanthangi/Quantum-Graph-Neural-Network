# Quantum Graph Neural Network (QGNN) – Qubit-Based Message Passing on Graphs

## What This Project Does
- Represents each node of a graph with a single qubit.
- Encodes node features as simple rotation angles on those qubits.
- Uses entangling gates on graph edges to perform message passing between qubits.
- Measures qubits to obtain node and graph embeddings, then applies a tiny classical classifier.
- Compares the quantum-inspired model to a lightweight classical GNN baseline.

## Why Quantum for Graphs?
- Graphs naturally contain correlated nodes.
- Qubit entanglement is a natural way to model those correlations.
- Quantum circuits can implement expressive message-passing patterns.

## Why SVG Instead of PNG
GitHub’s CODEX interface cannot preview binary image files like PNG or JPG and often shows “Binary files are not supported” in pull request views. To avoid this, all visualizations in this repository are saved as lightweight SVG (vector) images. SVGs are text-based, easy to diff, and render cleanly inside GitHub and CODEX.

## How the QGNN Works (Plain English)
- Each graph node owns one qubit.
- Node features turn into rotation angles that prepare the qubit state.
- Every edge triggers an entangling gate so neighboring qubits exchange information.
- After one or more layers, we measure the qubits to get classical embeddings.
- A small linear head uses these embeddings to predict graph labels.

## Repository Structure
- `app/` – source code for graph generation, QGNN layers, classical baseline, training, and plotting.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook tutorial.
- `examples/` – SVG plots generated by the demo pipeline.
- `tests/` – lightweight unit tests.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py
```

Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/qgnn_demo.ipynb
```

## What You Should See
